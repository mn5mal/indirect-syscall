# indirect-syscall
    Let’s set the stage before we get into the article itself, because it’s very important to understand the system first.
    Think of it like this: on your computer or phone, apps can’t just grab whatever they want—memory, files and etc... They gotta ask the kernel, the system’s main guard, for a green light. And they do that through a series of APIs. It’s all about keeping things locked down, so one bad app doesn’t crash everything. These APIs come in two types: documented ones (like kernel32.dll and kernelbase.dll) and undocumented ones (like ntdll.dll). Microsoft probably did this to stop devs or malicious actors from getting too comfortable with the deep system structure.
